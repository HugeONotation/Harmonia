# Objects and Representation
* one of the main limitations of the current struct/class model is that the memory representation is specified by 
  the same mechanism by which the members are specified
* similarly, there is a tie between inheritance and polymorphism, as well as the common memory representation that 
  is shared
* ideally, all of these details should be possible to specify individually.
* row polymorphism should be a available as a mechanism which 
* inheritance and classic classes should be possible to implement via a combination of the feature that Harmonia 
  will offer
